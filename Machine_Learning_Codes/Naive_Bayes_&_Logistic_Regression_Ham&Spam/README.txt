######## Methods to Run the Code #######

A) To run Naive_Bayes.py

-> Place the training and testing data inside the folder
	
	"<Path_to_Project_Direc>/train"
	"<Path_to_Project_Direc>/test"

-> Give or edit the path to the training and testing data folers in the code

    : train_file_path_ham = './train//ham/*'
    : train_file_path_spam = './train//spam/*'

    : test_file_path_ham = './test//ham/*'
    : test_file_path_spam = './test//spam/*' 

-> Run the code : "python3 Naive_Bayes.py"

B) To run Logistic_Regression.py

-> Place the training and testing data inside the folder
	
	"<Path_to_Project_Direc>/train"
	"<Path_to_Project_Direc>/test"

-> Give or edit the path to the training and testing data folers in the code

    : main_train_dir = "./train"
    : main_test_dir = "./test" 

-> Run the code : "python3 Logistic_Regression.py"
